# VS Code Custom Editor Example Re-implemented in Svelte
This is a re-implementation of [Cat Customs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/custom-editor-sample), the VS Code example for building [Custom Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors) views, but with using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
